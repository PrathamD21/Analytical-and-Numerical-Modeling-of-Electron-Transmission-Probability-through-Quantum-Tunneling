# Analytical-and-Numerical-Modeling-of-Electron-Transmission-Probability-through-Quantum-Tunneling
QuantumTransportLab is a Python-based simulation framework for modeling quantum tunneling in nanoscale devices. Implements Schrödinger–Poisson, Transfer Matrix, Landauer, and Monte Carlo methods to analyze MIM, RTD, and TFET structures with inelastic scattering and statistical variability.
